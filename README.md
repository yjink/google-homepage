This is a fake google project. When I'm done, I will have demonstarted the following skills:

1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
    a) Float
    b) Move
2. Stick a div onto the top or bottom of the page 
    (like in the footer header way I assume)
3. ID the bg color of an existing webpage: 
    Inspect!!
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
    INSPECT!!
5. Center an element horizontally
    Align center
6. Identify three ways you can iinclude your CSS styles in a page
    a) internal via <style> tag
    b) external via CSS page
    c) inline CSS, adding CSS directly into tags
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
    a) ID = #
    b) class = .

And here we go!
